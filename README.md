This is a Sales Analysis using Python.

In this analysis, I explored the following 4 high-level business questions related to our data:

- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?

- What city sold the most product?

- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?

- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
